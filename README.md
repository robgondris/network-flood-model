# network-flood-model

This has the code for my project on Leaky Dams. There are four notebooks which present my code. Checking Data cleans the data, and does some exploratory analysis. Numerical Model and Hysteresis Model are the two different models, applied to the full network. Visualising gives code to make a gif that helps with visualising a flood.

The complete rain data that is shown in the preview to Checking Data is too large for GitHub, so cut down versions which still include storm Ciara are used instead. They need to be unzipped if you want to run the code yourself.

Read the attached pdf paper for details about the derivation and use of the models, and the source of the used data.
